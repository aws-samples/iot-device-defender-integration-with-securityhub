## How to import AWS IoT Device Defender audit findings into Security Hub 

In this solution, we show how you can import AWS IoT Device Defender audit findings into Security Hub. You can then view and organize Internet of Things (IoT) security findings in Security Hub together with findings from other integrated AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, AWS Systems Manager, and more. You will gain a centralized security view across both enterprise and IoT types of workloads, and have an aggregated view of AWS IoT Device Defender audit findings. This solution can support AWS Accounts managed by AWS Organizations.

Youâ€™ll learn how the integration of IoT security findings into Security Hub works, and you can download AWS CloudFormation templates to implement the solution. After you deploy the solution, every failed audit check will be recorded as a Security Hub finding.  The findings within Security Hub provides an AWS IoT Device Defender finding severity level and direct link to the AWS IoT Device Defender console so that you can take possible remediation actions. If you address the underlying findings or suppress the findings by using the AWS IoT Device Defender console, the solution function will automatically archive any related findings in Security Hub when a new audit occurs

## Deploying with CLI

- Create or re-use existing a S3 bucket in your account where you will upload the sources.  
- Set up your AWS credential for AWS CLI, see [Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)  
- Execute the deployment script with following parameters 
` ./deploy.sh s3bucket s3prefix aws-cli-profile aws-region`
  - *s3bucket* is where the sources will be uploaded
  - *s3prefix* is S3 object prefix to use without slash 
  - *aws-cli-rofile* is cli profile, use default if without profile 
  - *aws-region* is the region 
Example:
` ./deploy.sh my-test-bucket mypref default eu-west-1`
